how to use this backend

### Analysis Summary

The backend is an `inventory-api` that manages brands, categories, items, and locations.

# High-Level Architecture

The `inventory-api` is structured around a typical Node.js Express application pattern, with clear separation of concerns:

*   **`src/app.js`**: This file likely initializes the Express application, sets up middleware, and defines the main routing.
*   **`src/server.js`**: This file is responsible for starting the HTTP server and listening for incoming requests.
*   **`src/index.js`**: This is the entry point of the application, likely importing and running `server.js` and `app.js`.
*   **`src/routes`**: This directory contains route definitions for different resources (brand, category, item, location). `router.js` likely aggregates all these individual routes.
*   **`src/controllers`**: These files handle the business logic for each resource, processing requests, interacting with models, and sending responses.
*   **`src/models`**: These files define the data models (schemas) for the application, likely interacting with a database.
*   **`src/schemas`**: These files define validation schemas for incoming request bodies, ensuring data integrity.
*   **`src/middlewares`**: This directory contains middleware functions used for request processing, such as validation.
*   **`src/db/connection.js`**: This file handles the database connection.
*   **`src/utils`**: This directory contains utility functions, including general validations and response formatting.
*   **`config/default.json`**: This file likely holds configuration settings for the application.

## Getting Started

To use this backend, you'll typically follow these steps:

1.  **Database Setup**: The application connects to a database. You'll need to configure your database connection in `config/default.json` and ensure your database server is running. The `src/db/connection.js` (file:src/db/connection.js) file handles the database connection.
2.  **Install Dependencies**: Install the necessary Node.js packages using `npm install` (or `yarn install`).
3.  **Run the Application**: Start the server using `npm start` or `node src/index.js`.

## API Endpoints

The API provides endpoints for managing:

*   **Brands**: Handled by `src/routes/brand.js` (file:src/routes/brand.js) and `src/controllers/brand.js` (file:src/controllers/brand.js).
*   **Categories**: Handled by `src/routes/category.js` (file:src/routes/category.js) and `src/controllers/category.js` (file:src/controllers/category.js).
*   **Items**: Handled by `src/routes/item.js` (file:src/routes/item.js) and `src/controllers/item.js` (file:src/controllers/item.js).
*   **Locations**: Handled by `src/routes/location.js` (file:src/routes/location.js) and `src/controllers/location.js` (file:src/controllers/location.js).

Each resource likely supports standard CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. You can inspect the individual route files in `src/routes` to see the specific HTTP methods and paths for each endpoint.

## Request Validation

The application uses validation middleware (e.g., `src/middlewares/registerBrandValidation.js` (file:src/middlewares/registerBrandValidation.js)) and schemas (e.g., `src/schemas/brand.js` (file:src/schemas/brand.js)) to ensure that incoming requests have valid data.

## Testing

The `test` directory contains tests for the application, including `example.test.js` (file:test/example.test.js) and `register.test.js` (file:test/register.test.js). You can run these tests to verify the application's functionality.

## Docker

The presence of `Dockerfile`, `Dockerfile.dev`, and `docker-compose.yaml` indicates that the application can be containerized using Docker, which simplifies deployment and environment setup.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Understanding the High-Level Architecture**
   The `inventory-api` is a Node.js Express application designed to manage inventory resources like brands, categories, items, and locations. It follows a structured pattern with clear separation of concerns, including dedicated components for application initialization, server management, routing, business logic, data modeling, and utility functions.

2. **Getting Started with the Backend**
   To begin using the backend, you need to configure your database connection, typically in a configuration file, and ensure your database server is operational. After setting up the database, install the necessary project dependencies. Finally, you can start the application server to make the API accessible.

3. **Exploring API Endpoints**
   The API provides distinct endpoints for managing different inventory resources: Brands, Categories, Items, and Locations. Each resource has its own dedicated routing and controller logic, supporting standard CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. You can explore the specific routes to understand the available HTTP methods and paths for each resource.

4. **Understanding Request Validation**
   The application incorporates robust request validation to ensure data integrity. This is achieved through the use of validation middleware and predefined schemas that validate incoming request bodies against expected data structures and types.

5. **Running Tests**
   The codebase includes a `test` directory containing various tests to verify the application's functionality and ensure its reliability. These tests can be executed to confirm that all components are working as expected.

6. **Leveraging Docker for Deployment**
   The presence of Docker-related files indicates that the application is designed for containerization. This allows for simplified deployment and consistent environment setup across different development and production stages.
